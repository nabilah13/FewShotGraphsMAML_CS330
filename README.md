# FewShotGraphsMAML_CS330
Final project for Stanford's CS 330 course, Fall 2022

Each notebook explores few shot node classification on the Cora Graph Dataset using traditional graph learning versus meta-learning using MAML. This project replicates the results from earlier work (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09718.pdf) for the SGC and GCN models, while adding an additional experiment using a GAT model.
